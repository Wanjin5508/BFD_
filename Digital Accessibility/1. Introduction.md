# Intro
> Digital accessibility aims to ensure that everyone, regardless of their skills or abilities or disabilities, can **access information**, **technology**, **products**, and **services**.

- Learn from the experience of accessibility experts and disabled people.

- We are only temporarily not having a disability, because **at some point in our life as we get older**, we will have some sort of disability

## Businesses should care about digital accessibility
- for three main reasons. 
- 1. Firstly, there is quite clearly a commercial element. There's a huge untapped market when it comes to disabled people.

- 2. Secondly, it's the right thing to do. There's a clear social and moral element to this.

- 3. Thirdly, there's the legal argument. So it's not something that you can't not do. And there's equality legislation that means that you have to serve and be available for customers with disabilities.

-> Now, let me give you one example. In the '70s, we've had this **safety belt law** in the cars. And there were actually a lot of resistance. We don't believe that now, but people refused to put on the safety belt. But at that time, a law was needed to enforce this to the benefit of everybody. And I think it's the same with accessibility.

## Goal
Learners on this course will discover how to **create documents** that are easy to read, how to develop products that may be more **user friendly,** and perhaps, design **websites** that can be used with assistive technologies.

## Why BFD?
One of the great things about **technology** is that it enables people to do things they cannot do without. For instance, a person who cannot walk will use a wheelchair and then he can move. But if there's a step it's useless. **The environment is not accessible.** In the same way, a ***screen reader*** is a piece of software, which enables a blind person to use a computer but if the **content** is not accessible it's useless.

# Life Is Full of Challenges
- In this video, Neal Ewers talks about challenges and benefits of being blind, as experienced in his life.
- The disability of people may not always be obvious.

- Neal Ewers says, "Life is a challenge".
	- Distance recognization
	- blind since born : cannot understand 'seeing'
	- don't care overweighted
	- can hear who is friendly -> ability to judge a person
	- feel things with hand 

# What is digital accessibility?
- People have very **diverse needs** and abilities. Some products are designed to **take diversity into account** while others are not, and the latter category can be unusable for people with certain specific needs. 
- ***Accessibility*** refers to the **extent** to which products and services can be used by a wide range of people with varying needs and abilities. These **varying needs** and abilities may be due to *impairments*, *illness*, *ageing* or other causes.

- Accessibility can be achieved through a process of inclusive design or universal design (these terms are often used interchangeably).  The idea is to design **products and services** in a *people-centred* way. Inclusive design is not a specific design methodology; it is more like a philosophy that is applied to the design and development of products, systems, services, environments, etc.
- For example, think about a **staircase**. A person with a wheelchair cannot use it unless someone helps them, or there is a lift that can be used to move the person along the stairs together with the wheelchair. By including such a lift in the design of a path from A to B, it is designed **more inclusively than without**. We made the design **more accessible**.

- When you navigate the **digital world**, there are also good and bad examples of accessibility. Some web sites are really **straightforward to use** even if you have big difficulties with your vision. Others are so badly designed that even with full vision you are lost from the start.
- There are many other examples. ***Digital accessibility*** also includes mobile applications, like the apps in your smartphone. It covers both *online and offline activities* that involve a computerised device.  **Digital documents** are another example. Is the PDF file you just made really accessible? Most probably not, because accessibility does (typically) not come about by chance.

# Why Care About Digital Accessibility?
- [[#Businesses should care about digital accessibility]]
- ARIA principle
- Mobil accessibility is of paramount
	- many orgs move to a mobile-first architecture (design for a mobile device first, and then look at how can adapt to the web).

## How should businesses care about accessibility?
- market value: $ 1.38 trillion --> very wide market
	- their employee + customer
	- people with disability + inaccessible products affect the families of people with disabilities 
		- -> 公司损失的不仅仅是残疾客户, 更可能损失这些客户的家人
- corporate social responsibility

## Accessibility is context-dependent
- -> we cannot make things instantly accessible overnight, because of too much staff over there
- equality of access: we need to get everyone thinking about this
	- give people some disability awareness training

### Should accessibility training be mandatory?
- at least at minimum level
- just basic knowledge
- SO : go and find an executive sponsor.

# Accessibility and Usability
## Terms
> Usability:
- The term ‘Usability’ is normally used to refer to the **actual use** of the technology by a particular **target group** of users and contexts (e.g. including whether they find it easy to learn to use).

> Accessibility
- The term “Accessibility” is normally used to refer to the use of the technology by **everyone** rather than just a specific group of users (e.g. including whether blind people can also use the technology).

> User Experience
- The term “User Experience” is normally used to refer to any experience of a user that is related to the use of that technology (e.g. including **how they feel about** the brand and whether they can get it easily repaired).


While there have been many different guidelines produced for Usability, Accessibility and User Experience, only **Accessibility** has actual legislation making it illegal to disadvantage a disabled person through an inaccessible product or service. Some countries have general accessibility legislation while others have specific accessibility legislation for digital technologies.

## Relationship

The Venn diagram shows the relationship between User Experience, Usability and Accessibility with the intersection of the Usability and Accessibility circles being both usable and accessible while both usability and accessibility circles are contained in the user experience circle.

The word ‘**accessible**’ is however also often used by people to refer to whether a **technology** is **generally available** (e.g. “The internet was not accessible from my hotel because they did not have Wi-Fi”).  This can lead to confusion as there is no **legislation** requiring technology to be made available, only that there must not be **discrimination** against people with a disability.

# Dyslexia and Visual Stress
There may be issues with black text on a white background where the text appears to shimmer because of the **contrast levels** where coloured overlays or even dimming the screen can help prevent that feeling.  Text may appear to fall in rivers or form whirlpools disrupting concentration and others perceive the text as overlapping or disappearing and even jumping lines, which can be very disconcerting.     

Some of the smallest **misperceptions** can make an impact on reading because of the reversal or omission of letters and numbers.  Did you notice the changes that were made in this section?  Layout can also be an issue where a short line length and jagged edges of the text can be very helpful when reading down the page. Finally the type of **font** you choose can make a difference, the **gaps between the letters**, the difference in height between the lines and whether the font is serif or sans serif.  Luckily most technologies that offer reading via a screen also allow us to change settings and fonts.

Dyslexia and Visual Stress can be a combined issue for some readers when coping with *text on web pages or apps* on smart phones, tablets and computers, just as it can when reading books or papers.  Some contrast levels, font styles and size of print, plus the overall look and feel may cause increased reading difficulties. Nielsen Norman Group [(http://www.nngroup.com/articles/low-contrast/)](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/low-contrast/) has commented "**Low-contrast** text may be trendy, but it is also illegible, undiscoverable, and inaccessible. Instead, consider more usable alternatives." 

**Visual stress** can mean text merges, letters jump or ‘rivers’ appear down the page.  Although it is possible to make **fonts larger**, zooming does not necessarily clarify the text as the images also become magnified.  Reading whilst scrolling both across and down a page has become a requirement from a young age when using small phone screens. **Ideally text needs to reflow whatever the chosen size of font so the eye can comfortably follow the content and not be jolted as the page is moved.**

-> rivers

-> with fat words, better!

![[Pasted image 20231109202446.png]]
-> layout can also be an issue --> in 2 column, rather than 1

It may be that as one gets older bold black print on white, which can also make text more readable for those with visual impairments is helpful but sadly it can cause more problems for a user with visual stress.  The good news is that individual web pages of text can be altered to suit individual preferences. If a developer has set up accessible styles that can accommodate assistive technologies. Some individuals find the **option to change the colour** with a virtual overlay or via a different background colour may help.  Both these changes can be achieved through the use of **bookmarks, plugins or toolbars** in browsers. You can try this by adding the freely available ATbar (https://www.atbar.org/) to your browser or any number of other free browser extensions such as Color Overlay for Chromebooks . There are also programs for the Windows and Mac computers such as *TextHelp* Read and Write Gold and ClaroView that offer a complete virtual overlay over the screen in a wide range of colours.  A small free app that works well on Windows is T-Bar overlay ruler.

It is important to think about the **difference** between **graphical colour combinations and text- based colour combinations**.   Text needs to be comfortable to read and coloured images/bullet points can draw attention to important elements. The position of a screen and its relationship to the **lighting** used in the **environment** obviously has an effect on what is being read and it may be that ink paper used on tablets such as the Kindle can make text easier to read compared to backlit screens. Bearing this in mind, it is also important to remember not to depend on colour alone to impart information.

-> 针对不同的人群以及应用场景这两个维度选择合适的字体

Bsp.: [[Anna – dyslexia.pdf]] --> 色彩组合理论

The **position** of the text on the **screen** is also important - **avoiding clutter** and making good use of white space to delineate particular points in the content can assist all readers. Text that is left justified with a ragged right edge allows the reader to keep an eye on where they have reached on a long page or text, whereas justified text such as may be seen in a newspaper column, provides no such guide.  

 You can use ATbar (https://www.atbar.org/) to experiment with increased line spacing which can help solve the problem of text that appears to jump as you read along a line. Some guides also suggest restricting the width of lines to around 60-70 characters (BDA Style Guide) and some research says *even narrower columns can help increase reading speeds.*  There are readers who have dyslexia who find narrow fonts with very little character spacing **hard to cope with** and choosing a sans serif font, such as ‘Trebuchet MS’ or ‘Verdana’ with increased letter kerning, can increase readability.  It is also possible to add specially designed fonts to the list of fonts you see on your computer, such as **OpenDyslexic**, Lexie Readable and Read Regular.

# Accessible Audiovisual Media (Video and Audio Barriers)

## Accessible audiovisual media
- The sound can present barriers for people with impaired hearing
- ![[Pasted image 20231109202851.png]]
- --> less information 

![[Pasted image 20231109202951.png]]
![[Pasted image 20231109203031.png]]
- -> when captions are provided, better
	- Captions/subtitles: deaf people may prefer on-screen signing, but this is not always available.
	- ![[Pasted image 20231109203215.png]]

-> 视频的旁白

## to overcome barriers :
### captions
- ![[Pasted image 20231109203650.png]]
- if people speak too fast, we are not able to read ~
	- --> simplify the captions of long dialogue
- but only for recorded video, what if live video ?
	- scroll, speech recognization, may contain errors

### sign language
- ![[Pasted image 20231109204015.png]]

### subtitles
- ![[Pasted image 20231109203954.png]]
- translation
- deaf people? --> in the same language, explain what was happening
	- captions == **subtitles for deaf people**

### audio descriptions
- ![[Pasted image 20231109204150.png]]

### transcripts
- can be static or interactive

- text in meaningful sections
- "set timings" --> youtube will synchronize the time line automatically

# Barriers to Communication
To communicate successfully requires a combination of **physical**, **sensory** and **cognitive** abilities.  *Not everyone* has the ability to speak clearly, communicate needs and wants or understand others from birth and some may lose this ability during their lifetime. Up to one in seven people in Europe may have speech, language and literacy difficulties at some time in their lives.  

There are times when it can be helpful to **use symbols** for communication.  These are often made up of **simple pictograms**, **outline drawings** or icons that represent objects, parts of speech, actions and many aspects of daily living, education and the workplace. 

Well known symbols can also help us all when coping with a language we do not understand.  Take the image above - there are three symbols that tell us what is behind the door. If you cannot read Japanese you may have to guess what is there.

**Augmentative and Alternative Communication** (AAC) systems offer users the chance to communicate with the use of symbols or pictures as a way to express needs and wants along **with emotions** and self-determination.  The symbols or pictures may be used in an exchange of cards or by simply pointing at a symbol. However, it can be hard to send a message with all the correct grammar, for example, "The boys are planning a secret party and will buy a present for their best friend."

# Multiple Ways To Represent Images
Images can be represented in non-visual ways so that a **blind person** or a person with a visual perception disorder(including **search engines**!) can understand their meaning.  
- For a decorative image, no text is needed at all (since it has no meaning except for visual decoration).  
- For a **simple image**, such as a symbol or an icon, a **short text** **equivalent** is sufficient so that a screenreader can read the text equivalent in place of the image.  
- For a more **complex** image, such as a photo or a diagram, an additional image description is needed to convey its content in words.  Screenreaders can read image descriptions to users upon request.
