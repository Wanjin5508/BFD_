<p><strong>Heading Exercise&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heading Exercise</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a blank document using a word-processor of your choice</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tasks:</span></h3>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Include &ldquo;This is a heading 1&rdquo; as a first level heading.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Include &ldquo;This is a heading 2&rdquo; as a second level heading.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Include &ldquo;This is a heading 3&rdquo; as a level 3 heading.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Include &ldquo;This is a heading 4&rdquo; as a level 4 heading.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Include &ldquo;This is a paragraph. Lorem ipsum&hellip;&rdquo; as Body text. ( Note in some word processors this is referred to as Normal text).</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In each of the above tasks when you applied the appropriate heading style, a heading structural element was created. In the following tasks you are asked to mimic each of the headings that were created in tasks 1 to 4 just using text formatting. The difference will be that the output will simply be formatted text that looks like a heading. Assistive technology screen readers will not be able to use it for navigation and document skimming and other useful processes.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tasks:</span></h3>
<ol start="6">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mimic a heading 1 by simply applying appropriate text formatting to &ldquo;This is a heading 1&rdquo;. It should look the same as a heading 1. In other words it should be bolded if necessary , use a&nbsp; similar font, and have a similar font size and other similar features to that of the heading but it should not be designated as a heading..&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mimic a heading 2 by simply applying appropriate&nbsp; text formatting to &ldquo;This is a heading 2&rdquo;. It should look the same as a heading 2.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mimic a heading 3 by simply applying appropriate&nbsp; text formatting to &ldquo;This is a heading 3&rdquo;. It should look the same as a heading 3.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mimic a heading 4 by simply applying appropriate&nbsp; text formatting to &ldquo;This is a heading 4&rdquo;. It should look the same as a heading 4.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Change the style on Body Text so that the font is a sans serif font like Verdana or Arial and the font size is 11-point and the text is left justified. Serif based fonts and justified text can present difficulties for those with print difficulties.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Tasks 6 to 10 you have managed to create formatted text that is visually similar to properly defined headings. However assistive technology software (like screen readers) will not recognize it as a heading. It will process it as standard text. The user will not be aware that these are meant to be headings and will not be able to use them for navigational purposes, which is a key accessibility factor.&nbsp; For example, for the same purpose that sighted readers quickly scan a document, screen readers list headings so users can get a quick overview of a document&rsquo;s contents. Therefore, it is very important that headings are used to structure documents.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exercise 2&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6PTy2fBpskdT2JLOEZTZ3FNZU0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Document on Switches and Computers which can be downloaded from this Link</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is not structured. For this exercise, you are asked to reformat it in an accessible way by providing appropriate headings for the different sections, for example the sections on switch access and the section on scanning.&nbsp;</span></p>
