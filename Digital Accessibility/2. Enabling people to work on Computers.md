# Typical Desktop usage
- Access to information on the web
- communication
- online services
- documents
	- With word-processing software we can provide structure to our documents, lay them out professionally and insert pictures, tables, charts and shapes to deliver high- quality material. What a shame it would be, if we make them inaccessible in some way and prevent some people from reading them?

# Different ways to access the Desktop
Desktop input is typically done via keyboard and mouse. Desktop output is typically done via screen. In addition most standard configurations include loudspeakers and a microphone, or a headset, and a webcam.

## Alternative Input

-   **Speech recognition**  
    The user speaks into a microphone, and the computer **transcribes** this speech into text and commands.
-   **Virtual keyboard** (or *onscreen keyboard*)  
    A keyboard is *displayed on the screen* and the user uses a *pointing device* to hit keys by moving the cursor to this key and click on it. You probably use this kind of input on your mobile phone or tablet, where you touch the displayed keys directly with your finger or with a stylus. There are various ways of *using a pointing device* : it can be a *standard keyboard*, but also a *joystick* or a *trackball*. These devices can be connected where the user as some possibility of movement : some joysticks can be operated by the **mouth**, or with the **foot**. In that case the device is attached to the user’s wheelchair. Another way is to use a simple webcam and eye-gaze technology : the pointer follows user’s gaze, locating precisely where the user watches, and eye blink are recognised to click. 
-   **Switch access**  
    Users who have difficulties using a pointing device can use a *switch* to operate a virtual keyboard. A typical switch is a *button-like device* which has settings to fine-tune the *sensitivity* of the button. There are many forms of switches and these can *be attached to the muscle group* over which the user has most control. They include **hand switches, foot switches, head switches, mouth switches** (some can be operated by sip and puff), eyelid switches, skin switches and many more.  The system will scan the keyboard, highlighting successively keys or groups of keys, with a certain speed (adjustable) and the user press the switch to select a key or a group of key. In case of a group of keys, the process is repeated among the keys of this group. Other configurations might include two or more switches depending on the user capabilities.

## Alternative output

-   **Magnifying software**  放大软件 
    Many users with *limited sight capabilities* still use the screen, but they need to **enlarge** what’s displayed to be able to read text or to access graphics. They use magnifying software, which are able to resize the text font, to change background and foreground colors, and allow a large variety of settings (space between lines, kind of font etc.)
-   **Speech output** (or TTS, or Text to Speech)  
    Speech output is the common form of alternative output. Thought it is more and more used in mainstream applications, this is typically used with pieces of software called “screen readers” which literally speak out the text that appears on the computer screen. Voices used to sound “robotic” but a lot of research has been carried out to make them sound more natural.
-   **Braille devices**  
    These are hardware devices that are able to display characters in Braille, through round-tipped pins raising and lowering through holes in a flat surface. A typical Braille display includes a line of 30 to 40 Braille cells, each of them made of 8 such raising/lowering pins. Connected to a screen reader, they allow Braille readers to access to text. Though speech output is great to read a text, Braille displays are much more efficient when it comes to editing.

## Summary

> **The principle of accessibility is that all the content can be accessed and all the functions can be operated whatever input/ouput is needed by the user.** 

> This is similar to the accessibility of streets and buildings and transport, when steps and thresholds and bad design, prevent people with assistive technology (like a wheelchair for instance) from accessing the places where they need to be!

# Understanding The Principles of Software Accessibility

## The three dimensions of software accessibility

As seen in the video, software accessibility must be considered across three dimensions.

1.  **The operating system**  
    There is a need for accessibility support in the operating system. It transmits information from mainstream applications to access software (for instance the text of a menu item from your favorite word processor for the screen reader to read it), and specifies an accessibility interface (an API) so applications developers know how to expose this information to the operating system and what to expose. Nowadays most operating systems have a correct accessibility interface (see list at the end).  
    The operating system also usually propose settings which make access easier to some users, light high contrast theme in windows.
2.  **The application**  
    Then the **application** must implement the *accessibility interface* : for instance put *alternative text on image buttons* and expose it to the system, so it can be transmitted to the screen reader.

3.  **The Content**  
    Even with an **accessible application** on an **accessible system**, user **content** have to respect some accessibility guidelines. We will see these guidelines in the next step.

# Exploring Screen Readers

In this step we would like you to explore screen reader technology.

There are a number of possible technologies for consideration.  These include:

[**NVDA Screenreader**](http://www.nvaccess.org/download/)  

This is the Non Visual Desktop Access Screen Reader for Windows from the Non Visual Access Group, NVAccess.  A nice feature is that a portable version can be created and this can be run from a USB stick. Select Create Portable Version when following Download steps.

To access the user guide go to [NVDA User Guide](http://www.nvaccess.org/files/nvda/documentation/userGuide.html)  When using the system this can be accessed at any time under ‘Help’ in the NVDA menu. Press INSERT and the ‘N’ key or right click on the NVDA icon in your task bar. 

There are a number of community-run email lists where NVDA users can answer each other’s questions. There are lists for various locations and languages available at [NVDA Email Lists](https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda-community/wiki/Connect)

[Thunder](http://www.screenreader.net/) 

This is another Windows based Screen Reader you might consider.

For help in using Thunder go to  the [Thunder Guides](http://www.screenreader.net/index.php?pageid=38)

Thunder comes with a basic help file which you open with the Help menu item in Thunder. [English Help File.](http://www.webbie.org.uk/thunder/Help.txt)

[VoiceOver](http://www.apple.com/accessibility/osx/voiceover/)

For Mac OS X users the [VoiceOver](http://www.apple.com/accessibility/osx/voiceover/) Screen Reader is already built in .

Detailed help in getting started with VoiceOver is available at [VoiceOver Getting Started](https://www.apple.com/voiceover/info/guide/)

When using the system Help can be accessed by pressing the VO+H key sequence

Note VoiceOver uses the  VO+keystroke shorthand notation

VO + Keystroke is equivalent to Control+Option+keystroke key sequence

Visit [VoiceOver Basics](https://www.apple.com/voiceover/info/guide/_1124.html) for a  quick overview of commands

[**ORCA**](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Orca)

For Linux users Gnome’s [ORCA](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Orca) Screen Reader can be considered. Several Linux distributions include ORCA by default, for instance Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora and OpenSuse. You can get started with ORCA by visiting [instructions](https://help.gnome.org/users/orca/stable/) on Gnome Help website.

# Document Accessibility Guidelines

## 3 big principles:
Now we will focus on accessibility at the **content level**. There are 3 big principles: 

1.  structure 
2.  give alternatives
3.  identify

There are also a few additional items regrouped under the title “further considerations” below.

### Big principle 1: Structure

The idea is to use **structural elements (tags)** such as headings to properly structure document, and therefore identify clearly the various elements which compose the document. This can be done in both word-processed documents and in Websites. These structural elements are often referred to as **styles** in word-processors.

This is of particular importance for the following elements

-   Document title
-   Headings (of part, chapter, sessions, subsections, etc.), respecting their hierarchical order
-   Lists : use **true numbered and bulleted lists**.

As corollary, **presentation must be separated from content**. The layout properties of characters and paragraphs have to be set up independently from the structure. An example is about the **end-of-lines**. Do not use empty lines to put space between paragraphs, instead, use the properties of paragraph, where you can set precisely the space before and after the paragraph.

### Big principle 2: Give Alternatives

Every **non textual element** must have a **textual alternative**. In all cases this alternative needs to take the context into account. For instance a single picture might have different description whether it is used in a context or another. 

Non textual elements are from different nature :

-   **Images** : all images must have an *alternative text* (short and functional)
	-   In case of images conveying meaningful content, a **contextualised long description** must be provided, explaining all the information contained in the image. This is valid for instance ==in case of graphics presenting data, pictures illustrating text where information in the picture is not included in the text, schemas, etc. ==

-   **Sounds** : a text transcription is necessary, containing **all the text** said in the sound (if any), and all the meaningful other sounds.
	-   If necessary a video of the interpretation in Sign Language can be provided, to **improve understandability by deaf people** who don’t have a good understanding of written language. 

-   **Videos** : provide a **text transcription and subtitles**. Text description describes the scenes and contains also a transcript of all meaningful sounds. Subtitles can be developed from the transcription. 
	-   Like in the case of sounds, a Sign Language video may be necessary (see above)
	-   Audio-description may be necessary for blind users if the main content of the video cannot be understood without images.

### Big principle 3 : Identify

-   The **main language** of the document (as well as language of paragraphs/bits of text written in another language if any)
-   The **title** of the document (in document properties -- often called **metadata**), why not fill in other metadata (like author, description, etc.)
-   If possible provide abstracts at the beginning of substantial document components like chapters and major sections.
-   Make sure Link anchor text makes sense 

## Further Considerations

-   **Never use layout** (colour, bold, italics, alignment, etc.) to provide an information that would not be present explicitly in the text.
-   Avoid using a level of language which would be uselessly complicated (in particular *do not use very long paragraphs*).
-   Expand abbreviations and acronyms at first occurrence 
-   Keep tables simple – have a header row and make sure they read correctly row by row column by column 
-   Repeat headings of tables on each page if necessary (don’t do it manually, most editing software have an option to do that automatically)
-   Put accents even in capital letters (when writing in a language including accents)

## **Improve layout for people with print difficulties**

It is the access software which is responsible to adapt the document to users, at reading time, and this will work as long as these recommendations are respected. Nevertheless a few simple settings will be beneficial to a wide number of people.

-   Ensure that font size is sufficient, usually around 12 points or more.
-   Avoid Serif based fonts such as Times new Roman. All those extra decorative elements (Serifs) on characters present unnecessary additional challenges for those with print disabilities.
-   Use left alignment of text. The uneven spaces between words which are a feature of justified text present an extra cognitive load for significant groups of people.
-   Provide sufficient contrast.
-   Set the page background colour to a non-white colour e.g. a light pastel colour. This helps those impacted by visual stress sometimes called the glare effect or Scotopic sensitivity effect.
-   Do not use animated effects such as blinking text.

# Overview of Document Accessibility Checking

## Introduction

There are two basic stages in checking a document for accessibility, **automatic** and **manual** checking.

## Automatic Checking

This uses an automatic checker which is sometimes supplied with the *Word processor*.  For example MS-Word 2010 has an **inbuilt Accessibility checker** which will scan through the document and **report Accessibility violations**. The Accessibility Checker may have to be added to the ribbon. This can be done through the customise ribbon option. Add the Accessibility Checker from All commands

Some versions of Word-processors may not have an Accessibility Checker and you need to find out from its help menus or through a web search, if its available. 

One option is to convert the document to  PDF format and use a **PDF Accessibility Checker**.

Adobe provides an Accessibility checker with some versions of its reader.

A freeware PDF Accessibility Checker  is available at [PDF Acessibility Checker PAC](http://www.access-for-all.ch/en/pdf-lab/pdf-accessibility-checker-pac.html) This also works with NDVA Screen reader.

Automatic checkers are useful for quick Accessibility Checks but there are many things they cannot do. They **will not tell you if language is clear and simple**, if Link text makes sense or if alternative text for images is useful. A manual document check is likely to provide a more comprehensive accessibility check.

## **Manual Accessibility Checking**

This basically involves going through the document checking for breaches of accessibility guidelines. The following is a check list for a manual document check.

## **Check-list Manual Audit**

### Principle 1: Structure

-   Does the document have a *title*?
-   Are *proper Headings* (of part, chapter, sessions, subsections, etc.) used and do they impose proper hierarchical order e.g. do Heading 2s define subsections of Heading 1s, Heading 3s define subsections of Heading 2s and so on? See step 2.9.
-   *Lists*:  are true numbered and/or bulleted lists used?
-   Is presentation separate from structure? For example, there should be no additional blank lines inserted, whose purpose is to put spaces between paragraphs. Set the “space before/after” attribute for paragraphs instead. Also do not insert blank lines to move onto a new page. Insert  a page break instead. 
-   Similarly formatting should not be used to mimic headings.  

### Principle 2: Give Alternatives

-   *Images*: Do all images have an appropriate alternative text? See step 2.12
-   *Audio*: is there a text transcription containing all the text said in the sound (if any), and all the meaningful other sounds?
-   *Videos*: Is a text transcription and subtitles available?

### Principle 3: Identify
-    Is the main language of the document specified?
    
-    Are there other languages used and are these indicated?
    
-    Has the document metadata in the document properties been filled in. This includes metadata like title, author, description, etc.
    
-    Have abstracts for substantial document components like chapters and major sections, been provided?
    
-    Does link anchor text make sense?
    

### Other Considerations

-   Is there any use presentation feature such as colour, bold, italics, alignment, etc.  used to provide information that is not present explicitly in the text. For example are there important items in the document highlighted using a colour like red but their significance is not stated in the text.
-   Is the language used clear and simple?
-   Are paragraphs short?
-   Are abbreviations and acronyms expanded at the first occurrence?
-   Are tables simple – Do have a header row and do they read correctly row by row column by column?
-   Is the “Repeat headings on each page” option for tables set?
-   Are accents on letters present in both upper and lowercase (when writing in a language that has accents on letters e.g. French and Irish)

### Improve layout for people with print difficulties?

-   Is font size 12 points or more?
-   Is a sans serif font used?
-   Is text left aligned?
-   Is there sufficient contrast between background and foreground colours?
-   Is the page background colour a non-white colour e.g. a light pastel colour?
-   Are there any animated effects such as blinking text? Can they be switched off?

# Alternative Text
*Appropriate* Alternative Text *for images and other media* such as videos is one of the key content enablers for those that *cannot see the image.*  These include screen reader users such as the blind and visually impaired. It also includes those who have switched off image downloads due to slow internet connections

Alternative text should be concise and provide an *accurate description of the visual content*. In association with surrounding text it should accurately describe the content and purpose of the image. 

  

## **How to Insert Alternative text in a document**

Microsoft Office:  
[Inserting alternative text in Microsoft Office](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Add-alternative-text-to-a-picture-shape-chart-SmartArt-graphic-or-table-52327e7c-cecb-45d4-9367-f911aa442371)

LibreOffice Writer:  
- Step 1: In LibreOffice Writer version 4.4.4.3 To Insert alternative text for the image first select the  Image
- Step 2: Right Click Image and Select Image Option 
- Step 3:  When the Menu appears select the options tab
- Step 4: Type in Appropriate Alternative text and press ok

This video shows you how to provide alternative text for images in LibreOffice Writer.


## Alternative Text

The provision of useful alternative text for images is dependent on **a number of factors** apart from the content of the image itself. These factors include the purpose or role of the image within the document and the kind of image it is. For example is it a graph or a picture of some object or an image of text?  The context of the image, i.e. the page it occurs on, the overall purpose of the page or document in which it occurs and the content surrounding the image, plays a big part in determining appropriate alternative text for that image. Images must have text alternatives that describe the information, reflect the role, specify the function, indicate the target of the link or in the case of charts convey the data represented by the images.

In general alternative text should be accurate and equivalent- specifying the same information that the image is meant to convey. It should be concise and precise by representing the information in as many words as necessary, but no more than required. It should not be redundant, repeating the same information that is already available in the text content of the page where the image occurs. 

## **Categories of Images**

There are **three** broad categories of images, decorative, functional and informative. 

### Decorative Images

Decorative images are typically used for layout or visual aesthetic purposes. They do not provide information content on the page. They also do not represent links for example to the home page or important site functionality such as settings or save file. Examples of decorative images are line breaks or geometric patterns used to give the page a visual style. Alternative text is not specified for decorative images. The alt attribute is left empty in these cases, i.e. alt = “ “.  For more on decorative images see the[Web Access Initiative tutorial on Decorative images](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decorative/) or the [Web Accessibility in Mind (WEBAIM) Tutorial on Decorative Images](http://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/#decorative)

### Functional Images

Functional images are those images which represent functions or links within a page. Examples of functional images are those which appear on the ribbons of word processors representing formatting functions such as bold and italics, pictures of clipboards representing copy and paste functions, scissors representing cut, cans of paint representing fill functions and pictures of printers representing print functions. The text alternative for these functional images should say in one word what the function is. The alternative text for a printer image should be just “Print”.

Images which have links behind them like the classic Home icon, are also considered functional images.  The text alternative for these images should indicate the target page of the link. For example- the company logo on a web page often has a link to the site home page. Consider the Dublin Institute of Technology logo which has a link to the Dublin Institute of Technology home page on all web pages where it occurs. The appropriate alternative text for this image is “Dublin Institute of Technology home page”    

For more on functional images see the [Web Access Initiative tutorial on Functional images](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/functional/) or the [Web Accessibility in Mind (WEBAIM) Tutorial on Functional Images](http://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/#functional)

### Informative Images

Informative images are images that graphically represent **concepts and information**. The major kinds of informative images are listed below.

1.  Pictures, photos and illustrations are typical examples of informative images. The text alternative should be at least a short description conveying the essential information presented by the image. For more on Informative images see the [Web Access Initiative tutorial on Informative images](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/informative/) or the [Web Accessibility in Mind (WEBAIM) Tutorial on alternative text basics for Images](http://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/#basics)
2.  Images of text: **Readable text** is sometimes presented within an image. *If the image is not a logo, text in images should be avoided.* However, if images of text are used, the text alternative should contain the same words as in the image.

[https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/textual/](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/textual/)

1.  Complex images such as graphs and diagrams: To convey data or detailed information, the text alternative should be a full text equivalent of the data or information provided in the image. For more on complex images see the [Web Access Initiative tutorial on Complex images](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/complex/) or the [Web Accessibility in Mind (WEBAIM) Tutorial on Complex Images](http://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/#complex)

Sometimes there is more than one image to consider, for example a connected group of images or an image map.

1.  Groups of images: If multiple images convey a single piece of information for example a five star hotel rating represented by five pictures of stars, the text alternative for one image should convey the information conveyed by the entire group. For more on group images see the [Web Access Initiative tutorial on group images](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/groups/)
2.  Image maps: The text alternative for an image that contains multiple clickable areas, for example a map of a city with different areas such as the north and south side, should provide an overall context for the set of links. In addition, each individual clickable area should have alternative text that describes the purpose or destination of the link. . For more on Image maps see the [Web Access Initiative tutorial on Imagemaps](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/imagemap/) or the [Web Accessibility in Mind (WEBAIM) Tutorial on Image maps](http://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/#imagemaps)

# Headings

Headings are a vital structural element which facilitate quick scanning through a document. They provide document structure and break up long blocks of text which are difficult to read. They are used in many assistive technologies such as screen readers to allow the user to go quickly to sections of the document they are interested in. Headings are called Tags in PDF documents

A common mistake is to use style for example bold enlarged text instead of proper headings.  For example:

This is not a heading

or

**This is not a Heading even though it looks like one**

These are just examples of differently formatted text. They are not Headings. The following is an example of a Heading 1. It has been explicitly declared as such.

In this document, the title at the top _“Headings”_ is a real heading, it was set as “Heading 1” style, while the element _“Hierarchical structure”_ further on in the document is also a real heading, which has been set as “Heading 2”.

The rule is: separate presentation and content. Don’t use text formatting to mimic structure. Structural elements like Headings are used by assistive technology like screen readers to help navigate around the document. Heading options are available in all word processing software (LibreOffice, Ms Word, Google docs, etc.), typically under the styles menu. Heading styles may have different names in different software applications.

In the following video we will show how to declare headings using the LibreOffice Writer Wordprocessor

## Hierarchical structure

Note the element Hierarchical structure above is a heading 2. Hierarchical structure can be very different from one document to another. Some are divided into parts, each part itself divided into chapters, while others will have sections and sub-sections. The number of variants is unlimited.

It is very important to respect hierarchy of headings when using styles, in order to avoid misinterpretation by screen reading software. In most word processing software one can find a style “Title” and a set of “Heading n” (“Heading 1”, “Heading 2”, “Heading 3”, usually up to “Heading 10”). 

We will use “**Title**” for the **main title** of the document. There should be only one in a document. **Then** “Heading 1” will be used for the first hierarchical level of the document, “Heading 2” for the subdivisions of part of the text under “Heading 1”, and so on. 

lt is important to respect the hierarchical order of styles, so a “Heading 1” cannot be located within the scope of a “Heading 2”. Another thing to avoid absolutely is to insert directly “Heading 3” in the scope of a “Heading 1”, without any “Heading 2” elements. 

Note that in the particular case of Web, only 6 hierarchical headings are available, and the main title of the document being one of them (<H1>), so we will use the elements <h2> to <h6> for the internal structure of the document.
