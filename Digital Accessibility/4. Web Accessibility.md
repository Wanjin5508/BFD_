# Introduction to Web Accessibility
_“The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.”_

_Tim Berners-Lee_

The Web has become an important part of our lives. We use the Web for learning, work, entertainment, personal activities and social connections. The Web has **made life easier**, but it also **creates barriers for people** with different abilities and in different situations. Therefore, making web content accessible is essential for our everyday life and equal participation in the society.

In previous weeks you have learned about accessibility for multimedia, including images and videos, accessibility for documents, including Word and PDFs, and accessibility for mobile applications. While **multimedia** and **documents** can also be types of **Web content**, other web page elements such as *headings, links, colours and contrast, and forms* can also create barriers for users. The use of headings, colours and contrast was already covered in previous weeks. This week, we will focus on accessible web forms, since this is one of the more challenging types of web content to make accessible. For accessible links, please refer to [techniques for creating accessible hypertext](http://webaim.org/techniques/hypertext/).

This week you will learn 1) how to recognise and identify barriers in web content, 2) how to choose and apply accessible web content to avoid barriers, 3) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0, 4) how to test web accessibility and strengths and weaknesses of different testing methods, and 5) how to employ tools and plan user evaluations to test web content accessibility.

We will use an [example Web page](http://projects.cs.hioa.no/moocap/registration-before.html) including a simple form in this week.

There are already many online resources and tutorials on how to create accessible web content and how to evaluate and report web accessibility. During this week we will refer you to more specific online resources in more specific topics.

# **What Is Web Accessibility and Why Is It Important?** 

[Andre Meixner, Head of User Centred Test (Accessibility & Usability) at T-Systems Multimedia Solutions GmbH explains why accessible software solutions are important in work places.](https://youtu.be/ipKNMMeKhmI) 

Beyond workplaces, accessibility is important to allow everyone to actively participate in the digital information society, independent of when, where, why and how they want to do this. Web technologies have become one of our daily essentials: we use it to explore and create knowledge, to consume media and entertainment, for shopping and so forth. [**Web Accessibility**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/accessibility.php) is a subarea of digital accessibility and focuses on making the **Web accessible to everyone**. International organizations such as the [**Web Accessible Initiative (WAI)**](http://www.w3.org/WAI/) continuously enhance existing guidelines, recommendations, or standards that help developers, designers and testers to contribute to an accessible digital information society.

# Caption It!

Elements in an HTML document are grouped in a **tree like** structure called *Document Object Model* (DOM) of the page. Here is a simplified example of such a DOM:
![[Pasted image 20231112203801.png]]
-->  the web page has a **title** and a **body** containing the **content** of the webpage. The content starts with a heading followed by a paragraph and an image that has an alternative text. Blind persons can use this **structure** to **navigate** from one element to the next with their screenreader. In the following video, Daniel Pöll, a blind person from Austria, will show you how this is done in real life.

# Before and After Example: Web Forms

# **Example Web Form**

This simple before-and-after example illustrates some typical accessibility issues in web forms and how they can be addressed. These issues include required or obligatory input fields, labels for input fields, grouping of form controls for easier navigation and understanding, as well as error prevention. 

Before:

## **Barriers and Solutions**

The following section explains the main barriers in the “**before**” example and shows how they are addressed in the “**after**” example. 

## **Required fields**

In the “**before**” example, the colour red is used to show the required fields in the form. *Using colour as the sole method to provide necessary information is problematic for blind and colour-blind people*. An alternative other than colour should be provided. In the “after” example, a “ * ” is put in front of the label for the required field. It is also recommended that required fields should have the “required” attribute. For example,
`<input type="text" name="email" id="email" required>`

## **Label for input fields**

In the “before” example, the form controls (text input fields, radio buttons, checkboxes) are not explicitly associated with their (corresponding) labels. They are only "visually associated", i.e. through their positioning next to the fields). For example, the *input field description* “First name” refers only visually to the input field. When users move through form controls using the Tab key, screen readers usually do not read the surrounding text, which are the visual labels in the example. In order for the user to know what inputs are expected, it is necessary to associate the labels with their form controls. This can be achieved by using the “for” attribute for the label.

Instead of 

First name: <input type="text" name="firstname" id="firstname">

**It should be**

<label for="firstname">First name:</label><input type="text" name="firstname" **id="firstname"**>

The value of the “**for**” attribute in the label should be the same as the value of the “id” attribute in the control element.

## **Grouping form controls**

The combination of < fieldset> and < legend> is useful to provide a high-level description for a thematically related set of controls and labels. It not only makes it easier for users to understand the purpose of the group controls, but also provide support for keyboard navigation and screen readers. In the “after” example, the male and female radio buttons are grouped together. Note that the legend should not be too long since screen readers speak both the legend and the label for each of the input elements in the fieldset element.

<fieldset>

<legend>Gender</legend>

<input type="radio" name="gender" id="male" value="male" checked><label for="male">Male</label>

<br/>

<input type="radio" name="gender" id="female" value="female"><label for="female">Female</label>

<br/>

</fieldset>

## **Instructions for form controls**

It is often useful to add instructions for form controls, to specify what input is expected and in what format. The ****instructions**** are important for error prevention and particularly helpful for users with cognitive disabilities.

In many simple cases, providing instruction within the label is sufficient. For example, in the After example, 

<label for=“date-of-birth”>Date of birth (dd/mm/yyyy):</label><input type="text" name=" date-of-birth" id=" date-of-birth">

The input format for the “Date of birth” control is specified in its label with “(dd/mm/yyyy)”.

This is called in-line instruction. Sometime it is necessary to provide instruction outside the label, which allows more flexible positioning and design. This can be implemented by using WAI-ARIA attributes such as aria-labelledby, aria-describedby. [WAI-ARIA](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria) provides further information about these tags.

In addition to instructions within and outside labels, it is also a good practice to provide overall instructions that apply to the entire form before the < form> element.

## **Use of CAPTCHA**

In the “before” example, a CAPTCHA is used to differentiate computer programs from human beings, so that the server does not process the input by computer programs. 

When using screen readers, the CAPTCHA is often ignored and therefore invisible for people who depends on screen readers. 

For more discussion about accessibility issues of CAPTCHA, refer to [CAPTCHA accessibility criteria](https://captcha.com/accessibility/captcha-accessibility-criteria.html).

In the After example, the honeypot technique is used to replace the CAPTCHA. A hidden field is added to the form. It is invisible, so users will not fill anything into the field. But a computer program will be able to see the field and fill it. By checking whether the field is empty or not, the server is able to identify input from computer programs.

<input id="test_name" type="text" name="name" value="" />

test_name {

display: none;

}

In addition, the letters in the CAPTCHA are red and have very poor colour contrast. These create barriers for people with colour-blindness or low-vision.


# **Introduction to the history of WCAG** 

The topic of web accessibility is nearly as old as the web itself. Tim Berners-Lee had already mentioned web accessibility on the second World Wide Web conference in the year 1994. Just a few months later, in January 1995, Gregg Vanderheiden compiled and released the first guidelines on web accessibility.

In the subsequent years, countless other guidelines on web accessibility followed, released by many different authors and institutions. The university of Madison, Wisconsin, unified and recompiled many of them to the “Unified Web Site Accessibility Guidelines”. Version 8 of these guidelines can be seen as a starting point of the W3C’s WCAG guidelines.

One of the pioneers of web accessibility Mike Paciello of [The Paciello Group](https://www.paciellogroup.com/) will give you a short overview on the history of the WCAG.

# Where to find WCAG, and other related WAI documents

The WAI (Web Accessibility Initiative) provides a great number of documents describing a variety of important matters on web accessibility. The following is a short list of links to the most essential ones:

This web site provides all relevant information on the WAI, its goals and its past and latest projects.

# Introduction to Accessibility Testing

[Accessibility testing focuses on making the web accessible to users with disabilities.](http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/Overview.html)  One pillar of accessibility testing is **“conformance testing”** to check whether web pages comply with existing standards. The [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) is the main standard for web accessibility. It provides 12 **guidelines** according to 4 principles — perception, operability, understandability, and robustness — as well as **success criteria** for each guideline.

Alongside guidelines, WCAG 2.0 defines conformance requirements that you have to meet if you claim to comply with WCAG, for instance: 

- One **conformance level (A, AA or AAA)** must be met. 
- Conformance must be achieved for **full pages.** No part of a page must be excluded from conformance checking.
- All web pages that are needed to **complete a process** must conform at the specified level. For example, on a shopping site, if the first page of the payment process is covered by the conformance claim, all other pages that take you from the 'shopping cart' to the payment and the order confirmation must also be included.

The WAI (Web Accessibility initiative) has published a [demo](http://www.w3.org/WAI/demos/bad/after/home.html) illustrating the improvement of a web site by applying the WCAG 2.0. In the next step we will show you how conformance testing is applied practically. 

WCAG 2.0 does not claim to cover all issues that people with disabilities may encounter in web content. For this reason, checking conformance to WCAG 2.0 does not prove that a website is accessible to everybody. A real accessibility evaluation should therefore also include user testing. User tests allow you to identify issues that depend on users' wide variety of requirements, on the input and output technologies they use and on specific design issues. Tests like this will give you feedback on how your web site actually works for real people with disabilities.

User involvement in accessibility testing can be formal or informal, depending on your goal and your budget. Simple and informal tests can be sufficient to help you resolve specific problems or to check whether a new interaction method works for e.g. screen reader users. For example, you may ask an experience user of assistive technologies, such as [Carole from our user stories](http://gpii.eu/moocap/?page_id=35), to follow a specific scenario that involves the new interaction method that you want to add to your site.

More formal user tests can help you collect data on specific accessibility problems, functionalities or web pages. That is useful to increase your understanding of existing barriers or particular user needs. User tests can involve open discussions while a user is performing specific tasks on your website. Accessibility tests like this do not typically cover subjective measurements such as general satisfaction, effectivity or efficiency when performing tasks, since these can be covered by usability tests.

# How does conformance testing work? 

Conformance testing means testing whether a website meets or conforms to a specific set of accessibility requirements. In practice, this usually means testing whether a website meets the criteria defined in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0.  [The video on YouTube shows the sequence of conformance testing.](https://youtu.be/Q7LV0h0Netg)

# Conformance Testing (Automatic and Manual)

Conformance testing of a web site means testing to what extent it complies with WCAG or other types of guidelines or standards. There are two types of conformance testing. One is automatic testing, which is to use automatic tools to test the conformance. The other is manual testing, which is to use humans to check the conformance to criteria in guidelines or standards. 

## **Automatic testing**

There are quite a few [automated web accessibility evaluation tools](http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tools/) available. In this step we will cover two examples: [WAVE](http://wave.webaim.org/), Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool and [AChecker](http://achecker.ca/checker/index.php). Both can check conformance online. When you enter the URL of a web page, the tools will output a set of errors and warnings. Currently WAVE covers WCAG 2.0 (**level A and AA**) and the legal requirements that are part of Section 508 of the USA’s Rehabilitation Act. AChecker covers WCAG 1.0 and 2.0 (level A, AA, and AAA), Section 508, the requirements in the German ITV regulation, and the Italian Stanca Act.

## Manual Testing

One of the most commonly used manual testing methods is expert inspection. Expert inspection is conducted by accessibility experts, preferably with multiple experts as evaluators. Heuristic evaluation of web content is a type of expert inspection, which involves multiple evaluators examining and judging the compliance of web content to the criteria in standards or guidelines (“heuristics”).  The process of a heuristic evaluation for web content consists of the following steps:

1. Recruit evaluators (3-5 is recommended)
2. Decide which standard or guideline to utilise, make an evaluation form including the criteria to evaluate.
3. Each evaluator evaluates the web site individually and fills in the evaluation form. Assistive technologies such as screen readers, magnifier, high-contrast mode, should be used. In addition, different browsers and versions should be covered.
4. All evaluators gather to discuss their individual evaluations and compile a meta-level evaluation result, to show the most common violations, Table 1 shows the most common violations found are criteria 1, 4, and 5.

## **Strengths and Weaknesses of Conformance Testing**

The biggest advantages of **automatic** testing lie in its **speed** and **scalability**. It can quickly check a large web site with many pages on different browsers, operating systems and devices. It also does not make mistakes such as those humans make (e.g. forgetting to check some links or criteria). For a large web site, automatic testing can provide an overview of the accessibility conformance status very fast. During development of a web site, developers can also use automatic testing to check for possible problems in the web content design. However, automatic testing can only find accessibility problems that can be found programmatically such as if alternative text for a multimedia content exists, if the colour contrast meets the requirements, if a table has a header, or if a text input field in a form has a label.  

Manual testing allows finding accessibility problems that involve human understanding of the content. For example, an automatic testing tool can determine whether multimedia content has a descriptive text associated with it, but manual testing can find out whether the text provides enough information about the multimedia content. In addition, manual testing can test whether assistive technology can access the web content. For large web sites, manual testing requires systematic processes and methods in order to cover all the pages and elements. The accuracy of manual testing depends on the evaluator’s knowledge on principles and guidelines and understanding of the source code.

The combination of automatic testing and manual testing can take advantage of the strengths from both methods.

The weakness of conformance testing is that it misses the user’s perspective. Neither automatic testing nor manual testing involves real users. Therefore they are not able to cover the users’ real needs and requirements. Research has shown that only a portion of the accessibility problems encountered by real users is covered by the Success Criteria in WCAG 2.0 ([Power, Freire, Petrie, and Swallow, 2015](http://www-course.cs.york.ac.uk/advt/classes/class03/materials/Power,%20Freire,%20Petrie,%20Swallow%202012.pdf)).

# **Involving users in accessibility testing**

Involving users in accessibility testing increases the understanding of **specific barriers** and using assistive technologies. [The video on YouTube shows 2 examples what you typically don´t find in conformance tests but what you can learn from your end users](https://youtu.be/QJaLbQyu3ak).

# What You Need for User Testing

Involving users in **accessibility** tests is compatible with **usability** testing. The main difference is that *accessibility testing means to involve users with disabilities*, whereas in *usability testing, people without disabilities are usually recruited.* User testing with people with disabilities exposes accessibility issues and usability problems. So accessibility testing with users can be seen as one specific aspect of usability testing with distinctive features (see the image below: Accessibility and usability testing).
![[Pasted image 20231112212010.png]]

Conducting accessibility tests with users requires that the following questions be answered: 

1. What do I want to test? 
2. With whom should I test?  
3. How many participants do I need? 
4. Which tasks should be part of the evaluation?
5. What are the most suitable evaluation methods?

## **What do you want to test?**

Results from the conformance test are a starting point to find out which accessibility issues should be further investigated with real users. Additionally, your experience with assistive technologies is an indicator to decide what you want to test with end users. For instance, you might not be experienced enough to test whether forms or CAPTCHAS are accessible for people using a screen reader. In those cases, it will be beneficial to invite end users for user tests.  

## **With whom should I test?**

On the one hand, you should focus on targeted accessibility issues for which you want to collect user feedback. Accessibility issues mostly correlate with user requirements. For instance, if you want to check if a slideshow is navigable by screen readers, one target user group consist of blind people. On the other hand, you should focus on the user audience of the web site. If you are going to evaluate an e-learning platform which is designed for people with dyslexia, you should involve users affected by dyslexia. Also, it pays to know whether the target audience of your web site are novice, average or advanced users.  

## **How many participants do I need?**

There are varying statements on how many participants are needed to identify as much as problems. One recommendation (LINK: [http://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-many-test-users/](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-many-test-users/)) for qualitative user studies is that five are enough. As people with disabilities use web sites in significantly different ways, it is important to include more than one user per category, for instance 5 blind users, 5 people with dyslexia, etc. 

## **Which tasks should be part of the evaluation?**

Don|t ask users questions such as, “Do you think this form is accessible?” Instead, create smaller tasks around specific accessibility issues, for instance: “go to the home page and create an account” (including the page with the form for which you want to receive feedback). The selection of tasks should correspond with the main functionalities of the web site and reflect accessibility issues that are of interest. 

## **What are the most suitable evaluation methods?**

There is a broad variety of evaluation methods to involve users in the development of web sites. Most of them were developed for usability testing. However, it has been shown that involving people with disabilities in **user-centred design** requires some adaptations of traditional evaluation methods, for instance, tactile paper-prototyping for blind users (see the image below: Tactile paper prototype), or to consider advantages and disadvantages of using local and synchronous remote tests .
